# huffman_tree

Huffman tree is useful for compressing files.<br/>
In this project I use huffman tree for compress  `txt`  files.<br/>

## visualization

For visualization I use `OpenGl`. 

## start
make one `txt` file then <br/>
In root folder:
```
  make 
  ./run.sh *.txt
```
after that you can see `compressed.txt` file.
